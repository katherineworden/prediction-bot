- Balance/positions/orders show privately (ephemeral messages)
- Bundle operations work in DMs
- Market shows "üèÅ RESOLVED" status after resolution
- Trading blocked after resolution with clear error message
- Balances update correctly with winnings from resolution

### ‚úÖ Privacy Behaviors:
- `balance`, `positions`, `orders` commands show only to the user (ephemeral)
- Bundle buy/sell confirmations are private
- Buy/sell order confirmations are public (with Order ID)
- Transaction matches are public
- Error messages are private

### ‚úÖ DM Behaviors:
- Balance checking works in DMs
- Position checking works in DMs  
- Bundle operations work in DMs

## Troubleshooting

If commands aren't working:

1. **Check Railway logs:**
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```

2. **Verify bot permissions in Slack:**
   - Bot should have required OAuth scopes
   - Bot should be invited to the channel

3. **Check admin status:**
   - Run `@Prediction Market Bot help` and verify you see "Admin Commands" section

4. **Restart if needed:**
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```
