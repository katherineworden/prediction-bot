## What is this bot?
This bot lets you participate in prediction markets right in Slack. You can bet on outcomes of questions, trade with classmates, and see how good you are at predicting the future!

## About the LECTURE Market
The only market is called **LECTURE** and has 18 possible outcomes. You are betting on the most popular lecture.

**How this market resolves:** This market will resolve in favor of whichever lecture receives the most student votes on the poll "Which lecture was your favorite this quarter?"

- **Outcomes 1-15**: Regular course lectures 
- **Outcomes 16-18**: Guest lectures
- Outcomes are numbered starting from 1 (not 0) as they appear on Ed (the course discussion board)

## Getting Started
- You start with **1000 points** when you first use the bot
- Tag the bot (@bot) to run commands
- All trades happen instantly at current market prices

## Commands You Can Use

### Viewing Markets
```
@bot list markets          - See all active markets
@bot market [market_id]    - Get details about a specific market (case-insensitive)
```

### Trading
```
@bot buy [market_id] [outcome_id] [shares] [price]  - Buy shares in an outcome
@bot sell [market_id] [outcome_id] [shares] [price] - Sell shares you own
@bot bundle-buy [market_id] [shares]                - Buy 1 share of each outcome (private)
@bot bundle-sell [market_id] [shares]               - Sell 1 share of each outcome (private)
@bot cancel [market_id] [outcome_id] [order_id]     - Cancel an open order
```

**Note:** If you try to buy/sell without a price and see "Only 0 units could be filled", it means there are no matching orders. You need to place a limit order with a price instead.

**Examples:**
```
@bot buy LECTURE 5 10 0.45   - Buy 10 shares of lecture 5 at $0.45 each
@bot sell LECTURE 12 5 0.60  - Sell 5 shares of lecture 12 at $0.60 each
@bot bundle-buy LECTURE 3    - Buy 3 complete sets (private confirmation)
@bot cancel LECTURE 5 123    - Cancel order ID 123
```

### Check Your Status
```
@bot balance              - See how many points you have (private - only you see this)

**Privacy note:** Balance, positions, and orders are automatically shown privately to you only - no one else in the channel can see your financial information!

## Privacy: What's Public vs Private

### üîí Private (Only You See)
- **Your balance** - How much money you have
- **Your positions** - What shares you own
- **Your open orders** - Your pending buy/sell orders
- **Bundle operations** - Your bundle buy/sell confirmations
- **Error messages** - When something goes wrong

### üåê Public (Everyone Sees)
- **Buy/sell confirmations** - When you place an order (with Order ID)
- **Transaction matches** - When orders execute between traders
- **Market information** - Current prices and order books
- **Market creation** - New markets being created

### üí¨ Also Available in DMs (to reduce channel spam)
You can also DM the bot directly for:
- `balance` - Check your money privately
- `positions LECTURE` - Check your holdings privately  
- `bundle-buy LECTURE 5` - Buy bundles privately
- `bundle-sell LECTURE 2` - Sell bundles privately
- `help` - Get help privately

## How Markets Work

### Pricing
- Prices change based on supply and demand
- Popular outcomes get more expensive
- Unpopular outcomes get cheaper
- Bundle buying/selling keeps prices fair

### Making Money
- Buy low, sell high
- If you're right about an outcome, you win points when the market resolves
- If you're wrong, you lose the points you spent

### Market Resolution
- Staff will resolve markets at the end of the quarter
- Winners get paid based on the final outcome
- Losers lose their investment

## Example Trading Session

1. **See what markets exist:**
   ```
   @bot list markets
   ```

2. **Check market details:**
   ```
   @bot market LECTURE
   ```

3. **Buy some shares:**
   ```
   @bot buy LECTURE 8 20 0.55
   ```
   (Buy 20 shares of lecture 8 at $0.55 each - public confirmation, you get Order ID)

4. **Check your position privately:**
   ```
   @bot positions LECTURE
   ```
   (Only you see your holdings)

5. **Check your orders privately:**
   ```
   @bot orders LECTURE
   ```
   (Only you see your pending orders)

6. **Cancel or sell if price moves:**
   ```
   @bot cancel LECTURE 8 123    # Cancel order ID 123
   @bot sell LECTURE 8 10 0.65  # Or sell at higher price
   ```

## Understanding the Numbers

When you see a market, prices show probability:
- **$0.70** = 70% chance of happening
- **$0.30** = 30% chance of happening  
- **$0.90** = 90% chance (very likely)
- **$0.10** = 10% chance (very unlikely)

All outcome prices in a market add up to $1.00.

**Sum of Best Bids/Asks:** When viewing a market, you'll see these sums. In an efficient market, they should both be close to $1.00. If the sum is significantly below or above $1.00, there may be arbitrage opportunities through bundle trading!

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I make money?**
A: Buy shares when you think they're underpriced, sell when overpriced, or hold until market resolves if you're confident.

**Q: Can I lose more than I have?**
A: No! The bot prevents you from spending more points than you have.

**Q: Can I create my own markets?**
A: No, only staff can create and resolve markets.

**Q: When do markets close?**
A: Staff will resolve markets at the end of the quarter when the real outcome is known.

**Q: Can I cancel a trade?**
A: Yes! You can cancel open orders that haven't been filled yet using `@bot cancel [market_id] [outcome_id] [order_id]`. This returns your escrowed money or shares. However, once an order is executed (matched with another trader), that transaction is final.

**Q: How do I see my trading history?**
A: Use `@bot positions LECTURE` to see current holdings and `@bot orders LECTURE` to see pending orders. Full history isn't shown but you can track your balance changes.

**Q: How do I find my Order ID to cancel?**
A: When you place a buy or sell order, you'll get a confirmation message with the Order ID. You can also use `@bot orders LECTURE` to see all your open orders with their IDs.

**Q: What happens if I run out of points?**
A: You can still participate in markets that resolve in your favor, but you won't be able to make new trades until your balance increases.
