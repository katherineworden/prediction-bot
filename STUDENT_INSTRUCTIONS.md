### Trading
```
@bot buy [market_id] [outcome_id] [shares]     - Buy shares in an outcome

## How Markets Work

### Pricing
- Prices change based on supply and demand
- Popular outcomes get more expensive
- Unpopular outcomes get cheaper
- Bundle buying/selling keeps prices fair

### Making Money
- Buy low, sell high
- If you're right about an outcome, you win points when the market resolves
- If you're wrong, you lose the points you spent

### Market Resolution
- Staff will resolve markets at the end of the quarter
- Winners get paid based on the final outcome
- Losers lose their investment

## Example Trading Session

1. **See what markets exist:**
   ```
   @bot list markets
   ```

2. **Check market details:**
   ```
   @bot market 1
   ```

3. **Buy some shares:**
   ```
   @bot buy 1 1 20
   ```
   (Buy 20 shares of outcome 1 in market 1)

4. **Check your position:**
   ```
   @bot positions
   ```

5. **Sell if price goes up:**
   ```
   @bot sell 1 1 10
   ```
   (Sell 10 shares for profit)

## Understanding the Numbers

When you see a market, prices show probability:
- **$0.70** = 70% chance of happening
- **$0.30** = 30% chance of happening  
- **$0.90** = 90% chance (very likely)
- **$0.10** = 10% chance (very unlikely)

All outcome prices in a market add up to $1.00.

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I make money?**
A: Buy shares when you think they're underpriced, sell when overpriced, or hold until market resolves if you're confident.

**Q: Can I lose more than I have?**
A: No! The bot prevents you from spending more points than you have.

**Q: Can I create my own markets?**
A: No, only staff can create and resolve markets.

**Q: When do markets close?**
A: Staff will resolve markets at the end of the quarter when the real outcome is known.

**Q: Can I cancel a trade?**
A: No, all trades are final. Think before you trade!

**Q: How do I see my trading history?**
A: Use `@bot positions` to see current holdings. Full history isn't shown but you can track your balance changes.

**Q: What happens if I run out of points?**
A: You can still participate in markets that resolve in your favor, but you won't be able to make new trades until your balance increases.
