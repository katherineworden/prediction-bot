## Privacy: What's Public vs Private

### üîí Private (Only You See)
- **Your balance** - How much money you have
- **Your positions** - What shares you own
- **Your open orders** - Your pending buy/sell orders
- **Bundle operations** - Your bundle buy/sell confirmations
- **Error messages** - When something goes wrong

### üåê Public (Everyone Sees)
- **Buy/sell confirmations** - When you place an order (with Order ID)
- **Transaction matches** - When orders execute between traders
- **Market information** - Current prices and order books
- **Market creation** - New markets being created

### üí¨ Also Available in DMs
You can also DM the bot directly for:
- `balance` - Check your money privately
- `positions` - Check your holdings privately  
- `help` - Get help privately

## How Markets Work

### Pricing
- Prices change based on supply and demand
- Popular outcomes get more expensive
- Unpopular outcomes get cheaper
- Bundle buying/selling keeps prices fair

### Making Money
- Buy low, sell high
- If you're right about an outcome, you win points when the market resolves
- If you're wrong, you lose the points you spent

### Market Resolution
- Staff will resolve markets at the end of the quarter
- Winners get paid based on the final outcome
- Losers lose their investment

## Example Trading Session

1. **See what markets exist:**
   ```
   @bot list markets
   ```

2. **Check market details:**
   ```
   @bot market 1
   ```

3. **Buy some shares:**
   ```
   @bot buy 1 1 20 0.55
   ```
   (Buy 20 shares of outcome 1 at $0.55 each - public confirmation, you get Order ID)

4. **Check your position privately:**
   ```
   @bot positions 1
   ```
   (Only you see your holdings)

5. **Check your orders privately:**
   ```
   @bot orders 1
   ```
   (Only you see your pending orders)

6. **Cancel or sell if price moves:**
   ```
   @bot cancel 1 1 123    # Cancel order ID 123
   @bot sell 1 1 10 0.65  # Or sell at higher price
   ```

## Understanding the Numbers

When you see a market, prices show probability:
- **$0.70** = 70% chance of happening
- **$0.30** = 30% chance of happening  
- **$0.90** = 90% chance (very likely)
- **$0.10** = 10% chance (very unlikely)

All outcome prices in a market add up to $1.00.

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I make money?**
A: Buy shares when you think they're underpriced, sell when overpriced, or hold until market resolves if you're confident.

**Q: Can I lose more than I have?**
A: No! The bot prevents you from spending more points than you have.

**Q: Can I create my own markets?**
A: No, only staff can create and resolve markets.

**Q: When do markets close?**
A: Staff will resolve markets at the end of the quarter when the real outcome is known.

**Q: Can I cancel a trade?**
A: No, all trades are final. Think before you trade!

**Q: How do I see my trading history?**
A: Use `@bot positions` to see current holdings. Full history isn't shown but you can track your balance changes.

**Q: What happens if I run out of points?**
A: You can still participate in markets that resolve in your favor, but you won't be able to make new trades until your balance increases.
